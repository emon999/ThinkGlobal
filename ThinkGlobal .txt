						<h2>Our Goal</h2>
						

					<p>The aim at Think Global is to provide undergraduate students with the best opportunities to help them thrive &amp; flourish on their own terms, attending their goals and aspirations. 
Think Global will offer a broad range of exciting exchange programmes for undergraduate university students all across New Zealand and are always on the hunt for new students to take on the exciting ‘one in a lifetime’ opportunities
We recognize that going on an exchange can be both very scary &amp; challenging, hence why we have created this website to further contribute to our vision in aiding to eliminate those potentially daunting factors that may prohibit you from experiencing and going out of your comfort zone to try something new. 
Thus,Think Global provides exchange programmes that contribute to the understanding and learning of societies within different cultures, religions, political, and economic systems.
